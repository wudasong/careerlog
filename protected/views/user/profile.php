<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
PHP programmer with strong front-end skills (JS, css3, html5)
<br />
I am a strong server-side, back-end developer in C++, Java, PHP, and related
technologies within the open-source technology stack (including Linux) such as
IP/UDP, SQL/MySQL, jQuery/Javascript, AJAX, Apache, and HTTP. I have
years of experience developing multithreaded applications at the Windows and
Linux OS/socket layer in C++, and more recently in Java. I am very strong
mathematically, with a deep understanding of mathematical principles at all
levels of complexity from basic number theory to multidimensional calculus,
linear algebra and Hilbert space theory. I have extensive experience with data
pipelining, database optimization, and system and unit profiling down to
individual software components and individual lines of code, including database
schema profiling as well as code profiling. My fluency across the stack includes
fairly extensive client-side development over the past few years along the PHP
stack, as well as Windows UI development in C++ with MFC. I have a PhD in
computational physics from Northeastern University where I studied
computational quantum algorithms in great detail.

<p>
My greatest strength lies in the area of algorithms, advanced mathematics (as mentioned,
I am deeply fluent with calculus and linear & matrix algebra, and this includes
advanced statistical modeling, Hilbert space theory, and differential equations,
including programming algorithms involving complex use of mathematics at
these levels), and server-based object-oriented development in C++ and PHP. I
write code that is meticulously clean, well-commented, and well-thought
through, especially involving complicated, dense, intricate back-end systems,
including architecture of commercial enterprise systems. I continue to improve
and expand my various skills. I submit detailed, line-item invoices, if necessary.
I work from both a personal office and from my home office in Greenfield,
Massachusetts.
</p>
<p>
I ask for a rate of $75 / hour (or equivalent) as a baseline – a bit higher or lower
depending on circumstances. I provide proposed work specifications in detail
ahead of time, indicating ahead of time if I see that significant time must be spent
to develop infrastructure, and on the other hand if I see that simple solutions are
possible that can be programmed quickly. I am always available to discuss the
specifications at any level of detail with the client.
I find that the most effective and cost-efficient projects occur when the manager is
engaged with the project for involved, hands-on discussions where ongoing
possibilities can be carefully hammered out in iterative fashion based on the
shifting reality on the ground to allow for the full range of overlapping
possibilities to be diligently considered and pursued, alongside ongoing
development and programming. I especially encourage managers who wish to
work in this fashion to contact me.

<h3>Education</h3> 
<p>
Ph.D. in Computational Physics from Northeastern University (2008)<br/>
B.S. in Physics from University of Massachusetts, Summa Cum Laude (2001)<br/>
Extensive background in professional computer programming (1990 – present)

<h3>Hobby programming</h3> 
<p>
Sudoku solver in C++ (2007). I designed a Sudoku solver computer program, including the front
end, for fun while others in my vacation did it the hard way. See my profile on Guru.com
for a screenshot.<br/>
Graphing Calculator in C++ (1998). I developed a graphing calculator, including both the
interface and the expression parser (from scratch).<br/>
All-around goofy guy who likes puzzles and tries to improve his chess game. Current ICC rating
seems to hover around 1450.
